* Point.im api bot
  I'm going to create a simple bot able to repost some messages from http://point.im blog to another services

* Usage
  Now you can try accessing point api through functions in .connection module
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ sbcl --load cl-point-bot.asd
  #+END_SRC
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload "cl-point-bot")
  (in-package :cl-point-bot)
  (defvar user (create-user (api-get "user/rayslava")))
  (slot-value user 'cl-point-bot.api::id)
  (slot-value name 'cl-point-bot.api::name
  #+END_SRC
  There are api-login and api-logout functions which are handling cookies and tokens automatically

* Plan
  - [X] https interaction
  - [X] Login/Logout
  - [X] api request functions
  - [ ] implement utf8 for posts and comments
  - [ ] CLOS classes for objects
  - [ ] websocket activities
